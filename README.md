# Screen_Recorder
Windows
VB .NET

Screen recorder to capture snapshots of the screen on a defined interval.
The Screen Recorder application will allow a user to capture the images of the screen at set intervals.  The images will be saved with a time stamp.

The images will be saved to the set location and can be played back in order.

If multiple monitors are detected the program will capture all in one snapshot.

The idea is to allow an investigator to run the program from a USB device, capturing images from the screen while the open programs are being reviewed.  No need to write down which programs were open and running.
